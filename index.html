					<div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-3 meta">
					</div>
  
					<p>My Solar Photovoltaic Project Analysis project in Excel provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the technical and economic aspects of implementing a solar photovoltaic (PV) project. Designed to assist in the decision-making process, this project offers calculations for determining the required number of solar modules, power output, and inverters based on project requirements. Additionally, it includes a financial analysis sheet that assesses the project's feasibility and provides key financial metrics.</p>
					<p>Key Features:</p>
					<ol>
					<li>Technical Calculations: Calculate the required number of solar modules and power output based on the project's specifications and energy requirements. These calculations help ensure accurate sizing and configuration of the PV system for optimal performance.</li>
					<li>Financial Analysis: Evaluate the economic viability of the solar PV project using various financial parameters and assumptions. The financial analysis sheet incorporates factors such as rated DC power, specific yield in the first year, electric rate, annual fee increase, PV module degradation, annual O&amp;M cost, discount rate for NPV, annual inflation, specific cost of capital, capital cost, debt percentage, debt amount, own funds, annual loan interest rate, loan term, capital recovery factor, annual fee, capital distribution, annual insurance, project useful life, and change of inverters. The financial analysis provides essential metrics, including Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Return on Investment (ROI), and Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE).</li>
					</ol>
					<p>This Excel-based project offers a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input their project-specific data and instantly obtain financial insights.
